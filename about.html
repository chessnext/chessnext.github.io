        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are a developer of two, who have been working on this project for about two years. The initial game was called Knight Rush. In the beginning there were only knights on the board. The player and enemies alike. Due to this design's flaws the new queen player was introduced. After further issues and by the intent to create more variety, the bishop and rook enemy were also introduced. At first, the project relied on Unity 3D and it was being built for the Android platform. Due to the increasing number of graphical bugs of unknown origin, one of us has decided to turn this into a web application instead. This time, with less emphasis on graphics and visual (and sound) effects. And so, this website was born.</p>
		<p>One of the original Unity project's purpose was to serve as a base for Gregory B.'s thesis. This purpose has been served. But the application still havent reached a widespread audience. We still think our AI algorithms are capable and they can give the players fun times. By making this web application we hope to avoid formerly unfixable bugs in our roughly 2500 lines of code. The other reason is accessibility. Not everyone uses an android phone, but clearly most people have an internet browser.</p>
		<p>We hope that when this project is finished it will give fun times to its players and a fresh new approach to a centuries old game.</p>
