        <h1>The game where chess meets survival.</h1>
		<p>In original chess, an important element of a game is strategy, which means a plan covering the whole game in order to win, gradually, by fulfilling smaller goals. At the beginning of the game, in the opening phase, this planning begins, which is usually aimed at controlling the middle four squares. It is important to build positions from which the pieces can effectively launch an attack, thus laying the foundation for the endgame and victory. </p>
		<p>
		An important part of this strategy is the time that comes from your own and your playing partner's thinking time, from the steps that result in clear or thought-provoking positions. If we use these steps well, we get the opportunity to plan thoroughly. Piece advantage is an important part of this. The activity takes into account the power of the pieces and the potential inherent in their position, which may change during the course of the game. And finally, the position of the pawns is also important, as they fundamentally influence the quality of the battlefield with their one-way movement.</p>
        <p>The interesting thing about Chess Next (former name: Knight Rush) is that it overturns the traditional planning process, since there is no opening, no pawns that can form the preferred formation. There is no king to protect, no time to manage, at least not as much as in traditional chess, due to the taking of turns. On the contrary, there is a pivotal point of the game that we can take advantage of against the listed disadvantages: the purpose of the pieces controlled by the game is known and does not change. When creating the game, it was a clear goal to create own solutions to a given problem, and not to have the pieces move following an algorithm that can be copied from the Internet. Consequently, the algorithms used in the program are far from optimal, but for a project of such a small volume, it is acceptable.</p>
